# My Capstone Project (Simple Snake Game)


## What is the project about?

This is the first capstone project of the second level of my web development boot camp. It is a very basic snake game created with create-react-app, built with componenets in React.js and styled using custon CSS. 

## How does the game work?

* You control the snake using the keypad arrows.
* Each time you collect a mouse (grey squares), a new one will pop up in a random place on the grid. 
* You gain 20 points for each mouse you collect and this will cause the snake to grow.
* The objective is to grow the snake and get the highest score you can before crashing into the wall.
* If you crash into the wall, it's game over but don't worry you can restart the game by clicking the ** restart ** button.
* You can also be reminded of the rules of the game by clicking the ** help ** button.

## How can you install the game?

You will need to have Node.js installed but yarn is suitable as well. This react app is named *compulsory-task-1*, in a folder named **TASK 12** which you can find in the **Web Development with React and Express** folder on [my dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/home/Tasneem%20Davids-68468) which you can download, or you can download the zip folder here on github as well by clicking the green code button. This react app directory will not have a node modules folder so you will have to install it on your local device. Once you have install Node.js (you can check that it's correctly installed by opening your command prompt and typing node -v as well as npx -v, and you will get the versions you installed), open your prompt and navigate to the compulsory-task-1 directory and run npm install. This will add the node modules folder that has all the things you'll need to successfully run the react-app. Once the installation is complete, you can then type npm start and that will run the app. I hope you like it!
